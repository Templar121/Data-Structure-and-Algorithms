<---- Roman Numeral to Integer ---->

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value  
I             1  
V             5  
X             10  
L             50  
C             100  
D             500  
M             1000  

For example:  
2 is written as II in Roman numeral (I + I).  
12 is written as XII (X + II).  
27 is written as XXVII (XX + V + II).  

Roman numerals are usually written from largest to smallest from left to right.  
However, in some cases, a smaller number is placed before a larger one to indicate subtraction.

Subtractive Cases:
- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) → 4 (IV) and 9 (IX)  
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) → 40 (XL) and 90 (XC)  
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) → 400 (CD) and 900 (CM)

The goal is to convert a valid Roman numeral string into its corresponding integer value.

Example:  
roman = "MCMXCIV"  
output = 1994  

Logic:  
Traverse the Roman numeral from left to right, compare current symbol with the next:  
- If the current value is less than the next, subtract it.  
- Otherwise, add it.

M = 1000  
CM = 900  
XC = 90  
IV = 4  
=> 1000 + 900 + 90 + 4 = 1994

Time Complexity of the Proposed Approach: O(N)  
Space Complexity: O(1)
