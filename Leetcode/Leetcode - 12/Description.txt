<---- Integer to Roman Numeral ---->

Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:

Symbol   Value  
I         1  
V         5  
X         10  
L         50  
C         100  
D         500  
M         1000  

Roman numerals are formed by appending the Roman equivalents of decimal place values from highest to lowest.

Conversion Rules:
1. **If the digit is not 4 or 9**, repeatedly subtract the **largest possible Roman value** and append the corresponding symbol.
2. **If the digit is 4 or 9**, use subtractive notation:
   - 4 → IV (5 - 1)  
   - 9 → IX (10 - 1)  
   - 40 → XL (50 - 10)  
   - 90 → XC (100 - 10)  
   - 400 → CD (500 - 100)  
   - 900 → CM (1000 - 100)

3. Only powers of 10 symbols (I, X, C, M) can be repeated up to 3 times. Symbols representing 5, 50, and 500 (V, L, D) cannot be repeated.  
   Example: 3 = III, 30 = XXX, but 4 = IV (not IIII), 40 = XL (not XXXX)

Example:
num = 1994  
output = "MCMXCIV"

Breakdown:
- 1000 → M  
- 900 → CM  
- 90 → XC  
- 4 → IV  
=> M + CM + XC + IV = "MCMXCIV"

Time Complexity of the Proposed Approach: O(1)  
Space Complexity: O(1)
