<---- Find Closest Number to Zero ---->

Given an integer array nums of size N , return the value of the element with value closest to 0. For multiple answers, return the largest.

Example: 
nums = [-4, -2, 1, 4, 8]
output: 

Time Complexity of the approach: O(N)
Space Complexity of the apporach: O(1)
