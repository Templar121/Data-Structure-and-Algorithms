<---- Merge Strings Alternatively ---->

You are given two trings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letter in alternating order, starting with word1. If one string is longer append the additional letters at the end.

Example:
word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
output: "apbqcr"

Logic: 
sol = [         ]
w1 =  [a  b  c]
w2 =  [  p  q  r]

Time Complexity of the Proposed Approach: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(N)
